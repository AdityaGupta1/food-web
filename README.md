**Technology**: I will learn about [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/), a JavaScript library for graphs.

**Rationale**: This is completely unrelated to my group's project since we're not using JavaScript. However, this will be useful for a different project in CIS 4500.

**Tutorial**: https://js.cytoscape.org/#getting-started

Note: the video is not of the code in this repository, but rather of the graph integrated with the database in a separate project.
